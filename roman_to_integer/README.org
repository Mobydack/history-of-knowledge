** Description

Roman numberals are represented by seven different symbols: *I*, *V*, *X*, *L*, *C*, *D* and *M*.

| Symbols | Integer value |
|---------+---------------|
| I       |             1 |
| V       |             5 |
| X       |            10 |
| L       |            50 |
| C       |           100 |
| M       |          1000 |

For example `2` is written as *II* in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
*12* is written as *XII*, which is simply *X + II*. The number *27* is wirtten as *XXVII*, which is *XX + V + II*.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smaller from left to right.
However, the numberal for four is not *IIII*. Instead, the number four  is written is *IV*.
Because the one is before the five we substract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine,
wich is written as *IX*. There're six instances where  substraction is used:
  - *I* can be placed before *V* (5) and *X* (10) to make 4 and 9.
  - *X* can be placed before *L* (50) and *C* (100) to make 40 and 90.
  - *C* can be placed before *D* (500) and *M* (1000) to make 400 and 900.


*** Example 1.
*Input*: *s = "III"*
*Output*: *3*
*Explanation*: *III = 3*

*** Example 2.
*Input*: *s = "LVIII"*
*Output*: *58*
*Explanation*: *L = 50, V = 5, III = 3*

*** Example 3.
*Input*: *s = "MCMXCIV"*
*Output*: *1994*
*Explanation*: *M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4*
